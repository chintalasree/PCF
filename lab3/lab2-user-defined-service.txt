Add a User-Provided Service Instance
------------------------------------------

In the enterprise, not all services will be provisioned by Pivotal Cloud Foundry.
For example, consider your Oracle RAC cluster. How can we connect our applications running on Pivotal
Cloud Foundry to these external systems?

1. Create a user-provided service instance.
cf create-user-provided-service attendee-service -p uri

This will create an interactive prompt. For the value of uri, enter your attendee-service application's
base url:

uri> https://{{attendees_app_uri}}/

2. Bind articulate to the attendee-service user-provided service.
cf bind-service articulate attendee-service

3. Restart the application
cf restart articulate

4. Refresh the articulate Services page. We can now see the attendee-service listed under Services.
