Accessing Apps with SSH

The Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI) lets you securely log into remote
host virtual machines (VMs) running Cloud Foundry application instances. 

1. Configuring SSH Access at the Application Level

enables SSH access to all instances of an app:
$ cf enable-ssh MY-AWESOME-APP

disables SSH access to all instances of an app:
$ cf disable-ssh MY-AWESOME-APP

2. Configuring SSH Access at the Space Level

Allows SSH access into all apps in a space:
$ cf allow-space-ssh SPACE-NAME

disallows SSH access into all apps in a space:
$ cf disallow-space-ssh SPACE-NAME

3. Checking SSH Permissions

check whether an app is accessible with SSH:
$ cf ssh-enabled MY-AWESOME-APP

check whether all apps running within a space are accessible with SSH:
$ cf space-ssh-allowed SPACE-NAME


4. Logging Into an Application Container with cf SSH
 cf ssh MY-AWESOME-APP


5. To log into the VM container hosting the third instance
$ cf ssh MY-AWESOME-APP -i 2
