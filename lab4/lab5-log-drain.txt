We will configure application log draining into a log analysis tool with 
a User Provided Service Instance

1. Sign up for a free Papertrail account

b. Browse to papertrailapp.com/systems/new
c. Select "I use Cloud Foundry"
d. "What should we call it?" give it a name - log-drain
e. Click "Save"
f. Take note of the url (logs7.papertrailapp.com:13281)


2. Create a User Provided Service Instance that streams logs to Papertrail.

cf create-user-provided-service articulate-log-drain -l syslog://{{syslog_drain_url}}

3. Bind the articulate-log-drain service to the articulate application.

cf bind-service articulate articulate-log-drain

4. View articulate in a browser. Refresh as necessary to generate logs.

5. To view the logs in Papertrail do the following:

b. Click on "log-drain"

6. Restart the articulate application and check the logs
