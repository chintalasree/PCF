Domains:
----------

1. HTTP domains indicate to a developer that only requests using the HTTP protocol 
will be routed to applications mapped to routes created from the domain. 

2. TCP domains indicate to a developer that requests over any TCP protocol, including 
HTTP, will be routed to applications mapped to routes created from the domain.

Shared Domains:
-------------------
Admins manage shared domains, which are available to users in all orgs of a 
Cloud Foundry deployment. An admin can offer multiple shared domains to users.

Admin Tasks
-------------
Create a Shared Domain:

Admins can create an HTTP shared domain with the cf create-shared-domain command:
$ cf create-shared-domain shared-domain.example.com

To create a TCP shared domain, first discover the name of the TCP Router Group.
$ cf router-groups

Internal Domain
------------------

The internal domain is a special type of shared domain used for app communication 
internal to the platform. When you enable service discovery, the internal domain 
apps.internal becomes provided for your use.

cf map-route RS-Service apps.internal --hostname  ws1
