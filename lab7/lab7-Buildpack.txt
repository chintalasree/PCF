Buildpack
----------- 

Buildpacks produce the droplets that are needed to run our applications. 
But how do we customize their behavior?

this example explore ways to configure the version of the java runtime that 
the java buildpack provisions for your application.

1. Review the Java Version reported by articulate

using the url
and
cf app articulate

2. Push articulate again, with a custom buildpack 

cf push articulate -p ./articulate-0.2.jar -b https://github.com/cloudfoundry/java-buildpack.git

3. Using your browser, refresh the articulate application.
It’s likely (but not required) that the Java Version changed.

Note: We instructed our application to use a custom buildpack. The Java Buildpack
source is continuously updated and it is an online package of the buildpack.

Change the Java version
----------------------------

1. To run articulate on a specific version Java.

cf set-env articulate JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE "{jre: { version: 1.8.0_45 }}"

2. Restage articulate.

cf restage articulate

3. Using your browser, refresh the articulate application.


Extra lab
----------

The context path that an application is deployed at can be configured by setting an 
environment variable

cf set-env articulate JBP_CONFIG_TOMCAT "{tomcat: { context_path: "/test" }}"


Note:

While using Java, what items do you think would need customization in your environment?
