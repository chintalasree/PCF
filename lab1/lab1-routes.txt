
1. Create an HTTP route:
    
    cf create-route SPACE DOMAIN [--hostname HOSTNAME] [--path PATH]

OPTIONS:
   --hostname, -n      Hostname for the HTTP route (required for shared domains)
   --path                   Path for the HTTP route
   --port                   Port for the TCP route
   --random-port       Create a random port for the TCP route

Ex :  cf create-route development cfapps.io  --hostname myapp  
        cf create-route development cfapps.io  --hostname myapp  --path info
			(route is : myapp.cfapps.io/info)


2. List Routes
$ cf routes

3. Check Routes
Developers cannot create a route that is already taken. To check whether a route is 
available, developers can use the cf check-route command.

cf check-route store shared-domain.example.com --path /products

4. Map a Route to Your Application
For an app to receive requests to a route, developers must map the route to the app 
with the cf map-route command. If the route does not already exist, this command
creates it.

cf map-route products shared-domain.example.com --hostname store --path products
cf map-route tcp-app tcp-domain.example.com --port 60000

5. Map a Route with Application Push
Developers can map a route to their app with the cf push command.

$ cf push myapp -d private-domain.example.com --hostname foo


6. push the application with random route
cf push myapp --random-route

7. Unmap a Route
Developers can remove a route from an app using the cf unmap-route command.

8. Delete a Route
Developers can delete a route from a space using the cf delete-route command.

9. To get statistics on each instance of a particular app.

$ cf app myapp
