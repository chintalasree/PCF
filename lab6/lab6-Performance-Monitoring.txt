Application Performance Monitoring
----------------------------------------

Letus use the newrelic managed service to setup application performance monitoring
for our app.

1. APM solutions cause applications to consume more memory. Increase the memory 
limit for each application.

cf scale articulate -m 1G -i 1

2. New Relic  trail version

1. Signup for a 60 day free trial license with New Relic.

2. Obtain license key.
This can be found under Account Settings from the drop down menu in the upper right
corner of the page.

3. Create a user provided service instance - it must be called "newrelic". This command 
will create an interactive prompt for the license-key:
cf create-user-provided-service newrelic -p license_key

Bind the New Relic Service Instance
----------------------------------------

1. Bind the newrelic service instance to articulate.
cf bind-service articulate newrelic

2. Restage articulate.
cf restage articulate

3. Bind the newrelic service instance to attendee-service.
cf bind-service attendee-service newrelic

4. Restage attendee-service.
cf restage attendee-service

Create Some Web Traffic and View in New Relic
-----------------------------------------------------
1. Refresh the articulate Service web page multiple times
2. New Relic -> select APM -> Overview -> Web trasactions time


Clean up
----------

1. Unbind newrelic service instance.
cf unbind-service articulate newrelic

2. Delete newrelic service instance.
cf delete-service newrelic

3. Scale back down to our original settings.
cf scale articulate -m 768M -i 1

4. Restage applications.
cf restage articulate


PCF Metrics
-------------

PCF Metrics provides application metrics for your application directly inside cloudfoundry.
It’s an innovative tool that combines application events, metrics (cpu, memory, network), 
and logs into a powerful view that can help you monitor and gain insight into your 
application’s behavior over time. In this lab you’ll take a little time to explore PCF Metrics
and its user interface
