1. List the security groups in your environment.
cf security-groups

2. PCF ships with multiple security groups. Pick two security groups from the
list and note the differences in the details of those security groups.

cf security-group public_networks

Managing ASGs
------------------
$ cf create-security-group
Try : cf create-security-group my-asg my-asg.json  (only for admin user)

$ cf update-security-group
$ cf delete-security-group

Binding ASGs to Running Applications
------------------------------------------

The command cf running-security-groups lists all security groups that apply to 
all running applications:

cf running-security-groups

Use these commands to apply (or unapply) a security group to all running applications:
$ cf bind-running-security-group my-asg
$ cf unbind-running-security-group my-asg

Binding ASGs to Application Staging
-----------------------------------------

Security groups can also control the behavior of scripts that stage an application. 
To list all security groups that apply to the staging of applications, use the command:

cf staging-security-groups

Use these commands to apply (or unapply) a security group to the application 
staging phase:

$ cf bind-staging-security-group all_open
$ cf unbind-staging-security-group all_open

Org and Space specific bindings
------------------------------------

The running-security-groups binding is coarse-grained; it applies to all running 
applications in a PCF installation. 

For finer-grained control of security groups to specific running applications, 
these commands can scope the binding to a specific org or space:

$ cf bind-security-group all_open my-org my-space
$ cf unbind-security-group all_open my-org my-space
