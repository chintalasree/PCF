Task Application
------------------

A task is an application or script whose code is included as part of a deployed application,
but runs independently in its own container.


About Tasks
-------------

In contrast to a long running process (LRP), tasks run for a finite amount of time, 
then stop. Tasks run in their own containers and are designed to use minimal 
resources. After a task runs, Cloud Foundry destroys the container running the task.

This is quite powerful in the scenarios where heavy workload can be run without having 
any dedicated machines for running batch applications.

As a single-use object, a task can be checked for its state and for a success or 
failure message.

Lab
-----

1).  labs/pcf-task-service>cf push -t 180

PCF will stage the application, create the droplet using the java buildpack and start 
a container instance to run the batch application task. 

2). Stop the application instance manually so that it can be run as a one-off task as needed.

3). Execute the following command to run the batch application as a task

cf run-task batch-example ".java-buildpack/open_jdk_jre/bin/java org.springframework.boot.loader.JarLauncher"

4). From console-> select batch-example-> Tasks -> check the status

5). Check the log for the output
